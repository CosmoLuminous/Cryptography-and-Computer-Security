How to Run:
• Open the jupyter notebook (Preferred). I have included .py file as well for your reference.
• Just run the notebook and simulation can be seen in the console below.
• I have hard coded the plain text message in the main(). So, no need to give any input. 
  If you want to try another input message then please paste that message in main() function 
    #Original Message
    alice_message = ["YOUR MESSAGE GOES HERE"]
• I have added sleep time of 0.5 sec after each step, so that results could be seen as simulation in the console.
