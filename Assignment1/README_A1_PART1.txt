How to run:
1. Open file 
	a. 2019SIY7580_AMAN_BHARDWAJ_HILL_CIPHER_ENCRYPT_DECRYPT.py and copy all code to Jupyter notebook in one cell. And Run it (Recommended)
	b. OR you can directly run through command prompt. python 2019SIY7580_AMAN_BHARDWAJ_HILL_CIPHER_CRYPTANALYSIS.py (python3 in case version >= 3)
2. Instructions To Run code:  
	a. Once you run the code, you will get options to choose from 2 operations: 
		Encrypt = 1 (Encrypt plain text with hill cipher)
		Decrypt = 2 (Decrypt cipher text to plain text)
		type desired operation number (1 or 2) and press Enter. 
	b. To Encrypt plain text with HillCipher enter 1 in the InputBox(Jupyter NB)/ConsoleInput(cmd) and to Decrypt cipher text to plain text type 2
	c. Based on the above options selected, next you will be asked to Enter following, through InputBox(Jupyter NB)/ConsoleInput(cmd)-  
		EITHER Plain Text in case Encrypt operation selected
		OR Cipher Text(HillCipher) in case Decrypt operation selected
		Copy and paste text from TestCases provided in EXAMPLES_A1_PART1.txt file in the given input box (make sure it should only contain a-z 				characters as per Prof. A.K.Bhateja)
		Press Enter
	d. Next you will be asked to enter Cipher Key Matrix:
		As per assignment instructions: It should be invertible square matrix		
		Eg. Key Matrix 
		[[22,  3],
		[ 9,  6]]
		should be entered as 22 3 9 6 (space separated)
		Enter the Key Matrix and Press Enter
		
	e. Once you enter the key, you will get the desired outpyt in the console.
	
	NOTE: You will have to run the 2019SIY7580_AMAN_BHARDWAJ_HILL_CIPHER_ENCRYPT_DECRYPT.py again for every operation
